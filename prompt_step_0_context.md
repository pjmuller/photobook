# Goal
Create a family album photobook creator as a single-page application.
The user assigns local images to predefined page layouts. The final deliverable of this tool is an `album.json` file that a separate process (out of scope of this project) can use to generate a PDF.

Prioritize simple, effective code, a clean UI, and a smooth user experience.
