# PDF Cover Generator

## Overview
`pdf_generator/generate_cover.py` creates a single-page cover PDF with back panel, spine (with year text), and front panel.

## Usage
```bash
python generate_cover.py <image_folder> <year>
```

## Key Specifications
- Height: 335mm (including 19mm bleed top/bottom)
- Base width: 758mm (for 6mm spine), increases with spine width
- Bleed: 19mm on all sides
- Layout: `| left bleed 19mm | back panel | Hinge 10mm | spine (6mm or more) | Hinge 10mm | front panel | right bleed 19mm |`

### Image Widths
The spine belongs to the front image. For base width W and spine S:
- Back image = `(W - S) / 2` → (758 - 6) / 2 = 376mm
- Front image = `(W + S) / 2` → (758 + 6) / 2 = 382mm

## Spine Width
Determined by paper page count: `(album_pages - 2) / 2`
- 24-34 pages → 6mm
- 36-46 pages → 7mm
- ... up to 200 pages → 19mm

## Image Placement
- Back cover (left): Image from last album page
- Front cover + spine (right): Image from first album page
- Year text: White, ~10mm height (28pt), centered vertically on spine

## Constraints
- First and last album pages must have layout '1' (single full-page image)
- Script exits with error if cover pages have multiple cells

## Note
`generate_pdf.py` automatically skips first/last pages — they are only used here for the cover.
