Split my prompt in multiple prompts so that we don't have to write all the code at once. But can let do LLM implement piece by piece.

Put extra attention on the first generation. Think carefully so that we create a great core frame ready to accept extra features later on without having to change the core.

The full prompt has been very thoroughly thought through. Stay very close to the original prompt (almost verbatim). Really focus on the splitting, not reimagining the prompt.
